The player can make dumplings by dragging around flour and fillings, deliver a lion dance performance, and write couplets with their fingers. They can joke around with a loving family at the New Yearâ€™s Eve dinner table, watch a Spring Festival gala, and shoot off fireworks just like in a typical Chinese household.
